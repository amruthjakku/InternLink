## 🔄 **Hierarchical Task Assignment Workflow**

### **Step 1: Admin Creates Tasks**
```javascript
// API: POST /api/admin/tasks
{
  title: "Weekly Progress Report",
  description: "Submit your weekly progress...",
  type: "assignment",
  priority: "medium",
  dueDate: "2024-01-20T23:59:59Z",
  points: 10,
  assignmentType: "hierarchical",
  assignedTo: {
    cohort: "cohort_id",
    colleges: ["college1_id", "college2_id"]
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: System Auto-Assignment**
- Task automatically assigned to all active users (interns + mentors) in selected colleges
- Users can view tasks in their dashboard
- Progress tracking and submissions handled per user

### **Step 3: Task Distribution**
```
Admin Creates Task
    ↓
Assigns to Cohort
    ↓
Selects Colleges in Cohort
    ↓
Auto-assigns to Users in Selected Colleges
    ↓
Users (AI developer Interns + Tech Leads) receive task
```

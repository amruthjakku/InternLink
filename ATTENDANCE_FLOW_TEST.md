# 🧪 Attendance System Flow Test

## ✅ **System Verification: Intern & Mentor Attendance → Admin Dashboard**

### **How the System Works**

1. **Interns and Mentors Mark Attendance**
   - Both interns and mentors can access the attendance widget on their dashboards
   - They click "Mark Attendance Now" button
   - System validates their IP against authorized networks
   - Attendance record is created with user details

2. **Attendance Data Structure**
   ```javascript
   {
     userId: session.user.id,
     userEmail: session.user.email,
     userName: session.user.name,
     userRole: session.user.role, // 'intern' or 'mentor'
     date: new Date(),
     ipAddress: clientIP,
     location: location || null,
     deviceInfo: deviceInfo || null,
     status: 'present',
     markedAt: new Date(),
     college: session.user.college || null
   }
   ```

3. **Admin Dashboard Displays All Attendance**
   - Admin can see attendance from ALL users (interns + mentors)
   - Filter by role: "All", "Intern", "Mentor"
   - Real-time updates when users mark attendance
   - Comprehensive analytics and insights

# Cohort Filtering and College Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cohort Filtering Not Working in Admin Dashboard
**Problem**: When selecting a cohort from dropdown in User Management, no interns were shown even though interns were assigned to that cohort.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic in `EnhancedUserManagement.js` assumed `user.cohortId` was always an object with `_id` property, but different API endpoints return it in different formats:
- Basic users API: returns `cohortId` as string
- Enhanced users API: returns `cohortId` as populated object

**Fix Applied**: Updated filtering logic to handle both formats:
```javascript
const matchesCohort = filterCohort === 'all' ||
  (filterCohort === 'none' && !user.cohortId) ||
  (user.cohortId && (
    // Handle both string cohortId and populated cohortId object
    (typeof user.cohortId === 'string' && user.cohortId === filterCohort) ||
    (typeof user.cohortId === 'object' && user.cohortId._id === filterCohort)
  ));
```

### 2. College Management Showing Zero Intern Counts
**Problem**: College cards in College Management showed 0 interns even when interns were assigned to those colleges.

**Root Cause**: The colleges API didn't include intern count statistics.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the colleges API (`/api/admin/colleges`) to include:
- `totalInterns`: Total number of interns for the college
- `activeInterns`: Number of active interns for the college  
- `internsWithCohorts`: Number of interns assigned to cohorts

### 3. Additional Consistency Fixes
**Problem**: Other parts of the codebase also assumed `cohortId` format inconsistently.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `middleware/dataSyncMiddleware.js` to handle both cohortId formats
- Updated `app/api/admin/users/sync/route.js` to handle both cohortId formats
- Added cohort filtering support to basic users API (`/api/admin/users`)

## Files Modified

1. `components/admin/EnhancedUserManagement.js` - Fixed cohort filtering logic
2. `app/api/admin/colleges/route.js` - Added intern count calculations
3. `app/admin/dashboard/page.js` - Updated college display to show intern counts
4. `middleware/dataSyncMiddleware.js` - Fixed cohortId handling
5. `app/api/admin/users/sync/route.js` - Fixed cohortId handling
6. `app/api/admin/users/route.js` - Added cohort filtering support

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
node scripts/test-cohort-filtering.js
```

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test Cohort Filtering:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → User Management
2. Assign some interns to a cohort using the Cohort Assignment tab
3. In User Management, select that cohort from the cohort filter dropdown
4. Verify that only interns assigned to that cohort are displayed

### Test College Intern Counts:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → College Management
2. Verify that college cards show correct counts for:
   - Total interns
   - Active interns  
   - Interns in cohorts
3. The counts should match the actual number of interns assigned to each college

## Deployment Notes

1. **Restart Required**: After applying these fixes, restart your development server
2. **Cache Clear**: Clear browser cache to ensure updated JavaScript is loaded
3. **Database Consistency**: If you have inconsistent data, consider running a data sync operation

## API Changes

### Enhanced Colleges API Response
The `/api/admin/colleges` endpoint now returns additional fields:
```json
{
  "colleges": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "name": "College Name",
      "totalInterns": 15,
      "activeInterns": 12,
      "internsWithCohorts": 10,
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Users API Filtering
The `/api/admin/users` endpoint now supports cohort filtering:
```
GET /api/admin/users?cohortId=<cohort_id>
GET /api/admin/users?cohortId=none  // Users without cohorts
```

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. Existing API calls will continue to work as before, with enhanced functionality added.
